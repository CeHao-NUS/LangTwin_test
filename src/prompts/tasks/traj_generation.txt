[Instruction Start]
You need to analyze how to finish the task considering the following questions: 
- What is the actionable part of this object to finish the task? If the gripper cannot hold the whole object, you need to call 
an external API to segment and locate the actionable part. 
- What is the constraints when interact with this object. For example, a drawer has prismatic joint constraint and a door has a 
revolute joint constraint. When there are certain constraint the restricts the manipulation, you should also call an external API to 
identify the type of the constraint and model the constraint. 
- What should the robot arm does to finish the task. At this moment, you are consider the actionable part and physical constraints. 

Your answer should describe the manipulation task in several steps. If the manipulatoin has more steps, you should use more blocks.
In each step, please answer in the JSON block format, the following is an example. 
{
    "Task": "",
    "Steps":
[{
    "Step": 1,
    "Perception": [],
    "Actionability": [],
    "Constraint": []
    "Movement": []
}

{
    "Step": 2,
    "Perception": [],
    "Actionability": [],
    "Constraint": []
    "Movement": []
}]
}

- The perception means which external API should be used. You only need to call their name.
When the perception is not empty, it means you use one or more external API.

- The actionability is which part should the gripper act. The empty actionability is to grasp the whole object by default. 
The actionability must use suitable perception to locate the actionable part.
You must make sure the actionability is necessary for current movement.

- The constraint is the restriction when manipulate the object. When the current movement is free, the constraint should be empty.
The constraint must use suitbale perception to help you identify the constraint type and parameters. 

- The movement means how the robot arm should do. And the movement cannot be empty, and it must tell how the robot moves. 
Also, if the manipulation has more than one movement, you should divide the movement and put then into more JSON blocks.
The individual movements are "move", "grasp", "release". They should not show in the same movement.
