[Work 2 Start]
Inputs: Robot, Scene, Task, Results in Work 1.
Outputs: Detailed steps to finish the task.

- From results in work 1, you need to consider the more details to finish the task.
- You need to move the robot hand and close or open the gripper hand to manipulate object.
- When grasping the object, find the actionable part of the object. 
- When moving the object, consider the physical constraint of the object.
- In the answers, use double backtick marks to quote the movement, (e.g. ``grasp``); use angle bracket to quote the target position (e.g. <apple>).
- Use sharp symbol to quote the actionabe keywords, (e.g. #actionable#).
- Use double sharp symbol to quote the constraint key words, (e.g. ##revolute joint constraint##) 


- You should answer like this examples in tripple asterisk.
