[Work 2 Start]
Inputs: Robot, Scene, Task, Results in Work 1.
Outputs: Detailed steps to finish the task.

- From results in work 1, you need to consider the more details to finish the task.
- You need to move the robot hand and close or open the gripper hand to manipulate object.
- When grasping the object, find the actionable part of the object. 
- If the task requires interaction with an object part (as opposed to the object as a whole), describe which part of the object would be most suitable for the gripper to interact with.
- When moving the object, consider the physical constraint of the object.
- Make sure to consider the object widths, lengths, and heights so that the gripper hand does not collide with another object or with the tabletop.
- When the gripper hand need to pick or place the object inside a container, it must first move "inside" and "outside" the container.
- In the answers, use double backtick marks to quote the movement, (e.g. ``grasp``); use angle bracket to quote the target position (e.g. <apple>).
- Use sharp symbol to quote the actionabe keywords, (e.g. #actionable#).
- Use double sharp symbol to quote the constraint key words, (e.g. ##revolute joint constraint##) 
- For every ``Move`` step, check if has constraints and write the analysis in (# contents).


- You should answer like this examples in tripple asterisk.

==== Work 2 ====
Sub-task 1: Open the drawer.
1. ``Move`` to the #actionable# <drawer handle>. (# ``move`` to <drawer handle> is free from constraint.)
2. ``Grasp`` the #actionable# <drawer handle>. 
3. ``Move`` to <drawer open position> with ## drawer prismatic joint constraint##. (# ``move`` to <drawer open position> has ## drawer prismatic joint constraint##.)
4. ``Release`` the gripper hand.

Sub-task 2: Pick the apple and place into the drawer.
1. ``Move``  to the #actionable# <apple>. (# ``move`` to <apple> is free from constraint.)
2. ``Grasp`` the #actionable# <apple>.
3. ``Move`` to the <inside drawer position>. (# ``move`` into <drawer> has container boundary constraint, so must move to <drawer inside position>.)
4. ``Release`` the gripper hand.
5. ``Move`` to the <outside drawer position>. (# ``move`` away from <drawer> has container boundary constraint, so must move to <drawer outside position>.)

Sub-task 3: Close the drawer.
1. ``Move`` the gripper hand to the #actionable# <drawer handle>. (# ``move`` to <drawer handle> is free from constraint.)
2. ``Grasp`` the #actionable# <drawer handle>. 
3. ``Move`` to <drawer close position> with ##drawer prismatic joint constraint##. (# ``move`` to <drawer close position> has ## drawer prismatic joint constraint##.)
4. ``Release`` the gripper hand.
