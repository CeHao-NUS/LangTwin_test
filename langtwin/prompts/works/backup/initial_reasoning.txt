[Instruction Start]
You receive two inputs: robot description and task description. 
- The robot description is the physical configuration of the robot. 
- The task description is what we ask the robot arm to do. And the robot should finish the task. 
- You should first thing about what are the sub tasks to do to finish the original long-horizon task.
- Then according to the sub tasks, then divide the task into several steps. 

We use <> to quote keywords that represent the target position. Please include <> in the answer.
We list some primitive action template, and you can only change the words in <>.

The action primitives are in the quotation: 
"
1. MOVE end-effector to <>.
2. GRASP <> with gripper hand.
3. RELEASE gripper hand.
"

Note that when moving the end-effector, you should consider the constraints like articulation and other obstacles.
When grasping the object with gripper hand, you should consider which part is actionable. 
The gripper hand can only GRASP one thing. You must RELEASE before next GRASP.

An example is, when you put an appele to the closed drawer, you should first open the drawer, then put the apple into the drawer, and finally 
close the drawer.
