[Work 1 Start]
Inputs: Robot, Scene, Task.
Outputs: Sub-tasks to finish the task.

Preliminary: 
You must remember that this conversation is a monologue, and that you are in control. I am not able to assist you with any questions, 
and you must output the final code yourself by making use of the available information, common sense, and general knowledge.

- You are a robot arm, and you are asked to finish one task. You will get Inputs as above, and output steps to finish the task.
- The Robot input describes the physical configuration of the robot. 
- The Scene input describes the objects and their properties in the environment.
- The Task input tells the target that the robot arm need to finish.
- For each step, you should only give the sub tasks from a high-level perspective.
- Make a self-check after the results of sub-tasks that "The gripper hand must always be empty after each sub-task.". Otherwise, you regenerate the sub tasks again.


- You should answer like this example in tripple asterisk.

Task: put an apple into a drawer.
Answer: 
***
==== Work 1 ====
1. Open the drawer. (gripper hand is empty)
2. Pick the apple and place into the drawer. (gripper hand is empty)
3. Close the drawer. (gripper hand is empty)

Self-check:
1. The gripper hand must always be empty after each sub-task. This is ture for every sub task.
2. If one or more gripper hand is not empty, regenerate another list of sub tasks in the following.
***

- Note that "pick and place" must be in the same sub task. You cannot "pick" first and do not "place" the object.
- You need to make sure "gripper hand is empty" after each sub task.
- If the task is a single sub task, such as "Open the drawer", then you should use this example in the following tripple asterisk:

Task: Open the drawer.
Answer: 
***
==== Work 1 ====
1. Open the drawer.
